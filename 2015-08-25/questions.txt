## How many are you?

In the first lecture, we ran a parallel protocol for counting attendance:

 - Rightmost person per row counts all in row
 - When done counting, raises hand
 - State number in row when called on

after which the instructor gets to gather and sum the row counts.

In practice, this took X time.  This includes

 - Time to start the process
 - Time to compute row counts
 - Time for the instructor to gather counts
 - Time for instructor to do the arithmetic

Consider the following questions:

1. What is a simple model that would predict this time?
	Assuming that per-row counting is done in parallel:
	Total time taken = 	  (time to start process/ explain procedure) 
						+ (longest time taken to count a row)
						+ (time for instructor to gather counts and do arithmetic)

2. What about a simple model to predict time for one person to count?
	We won't need to explain procedure/ gather counts/ go arithmetic, so:
	Total time taken 	= time to do a linear scan of the class
						= n_students * (time taken to count a student)

3. How big should the class be before the parallel method takes less time?
